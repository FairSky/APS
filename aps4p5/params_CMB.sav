A parameter file for the WMAP 7 likelihood function
Note: all keywords must be prefixed with a #

#dim 6 -- dimensionality of your parameter space

#Ns 2000 -- start with 2000 randomly sampled points
#end 200000 -- end after the algorithm has sampled 200000 points

#Nc 250 -- sample 250 candidates each time you use the Gaussian process
#Ng 15 -- use 15 neareast neighbors in the Gaussian process

#Nw 100 -- maximum number of wanderers
#grat 0.1 -- threshold at which wanderer is created

#chitarget 1280.669 -- target chi squared (where is your confidence limit?)
#chimintarget 1197  -- target minimum value of chi squared (for gradient
                       descent)

#write_every 300 -- write after sampling 300 points;
                    currently, the code will reassess the Kriging parameter
		    and test the structure of the kd tree every ten times it
		    writes


#outputfile test_aps4p5_wmap_out.sav -- the name of the output file
#resumefile test_wmap_seed.sav -- if you wanted to resume old #output file 
			(this line is currently commented out, note the '!')

#param 0 ombh2 0.01 0.04 -- the density of baryons
#param 1 omch2 0.05 0.2 -- the density fo dark matter
#param 2 h 0.5 0.8 -- the hubble parameter in units of 100 km/s/Mpc
#param 3 tau 0.01 0.15 -- optical depth to last scattering
#param 4 ns 0.8 1.1 -- scalar index controlling primordial power spectrum
#param 5 lnA 2.5 3.5 -- 10^10 ln(A) where A is normalizatin of primordial power spec.


below is a guess roughly approximating the known best fit point

#guess
0.02273 0.1099 0.72 0.087 0.963 3.1

you can include other guesses (forcing APS to sample points you are interested
in) by prefacing them with #guess and just listing their parameter values
